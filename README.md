# Let's DOMinate...
Karlie needs your helping making sure her super cool 
CHI 2017 DOM appreciation website DOMinstrates how we can use 
javascript to interact with our HTML elements.

### So let's get to it....
Here's what we need: 
1. When your mouse is over the text, the textbox should have a border, when your mouse leaves, the border should disappear. 
2. When your mouse is over the photo should make it round using the border-radius attribute.
3. Clicking on the button should change the title of the page to your very own DOM pun.
4. Clicking on the image should change it to a picture of either Karlie Kloss or your choice of interesting turtle picture.

### Want more....
* Make the background on the header change when you click on it
* Have the title text color change when your mouse is over the header area, if you really want to go crazy make it so only the "DOM" in the title changes.
* When you click on the image, make it move down and have a new image appear in its place.
